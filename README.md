# Deploying-Metabase-on-Amazon-ECS-with-Fargate-and-PostgreSQL-on-RDS


## 📌 Project Overview

In today’s data-driven world, many organizations struggle with scattered data and inconsistent reporting:

- Multiple databases managed by different teams.
- Random analyses built at different times with no standard approach.
- Non-technical staff repeatedly requesting “just one more report,” leaving data teams overwhelmed and unable to focus on strategic work.

Or maybe the organization simply needs a lightweight, open-source, web-based BI tool, one that’s easy to deploy, Docker-compatible, and puts data in the hands of everyone.

That’s exactly where **Metabase** comes in.

Metabase is an open-source business intelligence platform that makes data accessible to everyone, not just SQL experts. It connects seamlessly to popular databases, lets users explore data through an intuitive query builder, and turns results into beautiful dashboards and charts. For advanced users, it supports native SQL queries, modeling, and permissions. For everyone else, it delivers self-service analytics that are fast, reliable, and actionable.


## 🚀 What I Built

To deliver a production-ready solution, I deployed **Metabase on AWS** using a secure, scalable architecture. The setup ensures seamless database connectivity, robust security, and high availability, all without managing servers manually.


## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### 🔧 Key Components

- **Amazon ECS (Fargate)** – Runs the Metabase container serverlessly, removing the need for EC2 instance management.
- **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)** – Provides a secure, managed relational database to store Metabase metadata and configurations.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** – Routes incoming user traffic to ECS tasks and performs automatic health checks.
- **Target Group** – Registers healthy Metabase tasks and ensures traffic is directed only to running instances.
- **Security Groups** – Control traffic between the ALB, ECS tasks, and RDS for strict network security.
- **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** – Captures and stores container logs for monitoring, troubleshooting, and observability.

### 🔁 High-Level Workflow

1. A user accesses Metabase through the **Application Load Balancer**.
2. The ALB forwards the request to healthy Metabase tasks running on **ECS (Fargate)**.
3. Metabase connects to a **PostgreSQL database on Amazon RDS** to retrieve or store metadata.
4. Results are processed and visualized through the Metabase web interface.


## 🔐 Security Best Practices

To ensure this deployment is secure and production-ready, the following measures are implemented:

- 🔑 **AWS Secrets Manager** – Store and manage database credentials securely instead of using plain environment variables.
- 🧰 **Least Privilege IAM Policies** – Grant ECS task roles only the permissions they need.
- 🏆 **Multi-AZ RDS Deployment** – Enable high availability and failover support for the database.


## 📈 Results & Benefits

- ✅ **Self-service analytics** – Non-technical teams can explore data, build dashboards, and answer questions on their own.
- ✅ **Improved productivity** – Data teams focus on complex projects instead of handling repetitive reporting tasks.
- ✅ **Scalable infrastructure** – Fargate automatically scales tasks based on demand.
- ✅ **Secure by design** – Private networking, strict security group rules, and managed secrets reduce the attack surface.

This deployment transforms scattered data into a **single, reliable source of truth** and empowers organizations to make confident, data-driven decisions.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Amazon ECS (Fargate)** – Container orchestration (serverless)
- **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)** – Managed relational database
- **Amazon VPC** – Network isolation and connectivity
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** – Load balancing and health checks
- **AWS CloudWatch Logs** – Monitoring and logging
- **Docker Hub – `metabase/metabase`** – Official Metabase Docker image


## 📊 Conclusion

By deploying **Metabase on AWS ECS with RDS**, we combine the simplicity and flexibility of open-source BI with the power, scalability, and security of AWS cloud infrastructure. This solution turns data chaos into clarity, and helps organizations become truly data-driven.
